          Nawab Shah Alam Khan, Chairman, Anwar-ul-Uloom Educational Association
          is widely respected as one of the leading lights of education in
          general, and minority education in particular, in the country. A
          former Chairman of A.P. State Financial Corporation, Member of the
          Board of Management and Academic Senate of Osmania University and the
          Academic Council of Aligarh Muslim University, Nawab Shah Alam Khan
          has been the guiding spirit behind Anwar-ul-Uloom's growth and
          success. At the time that he took over the reins of the Anwar-ul-Uloom
          Educational Association more than three decades ago, the institutions
          under its aegis were in a state of neglect and stagnation.

        <p>
          He immediately got down to the task of creating academic ambience that
          the college lacked. This was followed up by a series of administrative
          and academic reforms that connected the academia with the world
          outside and made education significant and relevant. The introduction
          of Post-Graduate courses including M.B.A. in the late eighties is a
          measure of Nawab Shah Alam Kha's exemplary vision and foresight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under Nawab Shah Alam Khan's guidance and leadership The
          Anwar-ul-Uloom Educational Association has over the years, grown and
          ramified like a giant tree under whose tranquil shade many an
          institution thrives today. Of enormous significance in the
          Association's history are the establishment of Anwar-ul-Uloom College
          of Engineering and Technology at Vikarabad, as also the setting up of
          Aizza College of Engineering &amp; Technology at Mancherial, Nawab
          Shah Alam Khan College of Engineering &amp; Technology, (under the
          aegis of Madrasa-i-Aizza). These institutions bear testimony to Nawab
          Shah Alam Khan's vision of empowering students from the minority
          community with a sound technical education, which would in turn, pave
          the way for a bright career and a prosperous future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nawab Shah Alam Khan envisions a future for Anwar-ul-Uloom where it
          stands on par with world leaders in the field of education. His dream
          for Anwar-ul-Uloom encompasses an umbrella organization whose
          institutions set benchmarks in education and scale new academic peaks.
