        Nawab Shah Alam Khan, Chairman, Anwar-ul-Uloom Educational Association
        is widely respected as one of the leading lights of education in
        general, and minority education in particular, in the country. A former
        Chairman of A.P. State Financial Corporation, Member of the Board of
        Management and Academic Senate of Osmania University and the Academic
        Council of Aligarh Muslim University, Nawab Shah Alam Khan has been the
        guiding spirit behind Anwar-ul-Uloom's growth and success. At the time
        that he took over the reins of the Anwar-ul-Uloom Educational
        Association more than three decades ago, the institutions under its
        aegis were in a state of neglect and stagnation.

      <p>
        He immediately got down to the task of creating academic ambience that
        the college lacked. This was followed up by a series of administrative
        and academic reforms that connected the academia with the world outside
        and made education significant and relevant. The introduction of
        Post-Graduate courses including M.B.A. in the late eighties is a measure
        of Nawab Shah Alam Kha's exemplary vision and foresight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under Nawab Shah Alam Khan's guidance and leadership The Anwar-ul-Uloom
        Educational Association has over the years, grown and ramified like a
        giant tree under whose tranquil shade many an institution thrives today.
        Of enormous significance in the Association's history are the
        establishment of Anwar-ul-Uloom College of Engineering and Technology at
        Vikarabad, as also the setting up of Aizza College of Engineering &amp;
        Technology at Mancherial, Nawab Shah Alam Khan College of Engineering
        &amp; Technology, (under the aegis of Madrasa-i-Aizza). These
        institutions bear testimony to Nawab Shah Alam Khan's vision of
        empowering students from the minority community with a sound technical
        education, which would in turn, pave the way for a bright career and a
        prosperous future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nawab Shah Alam Khan envisions a future for Anwar-ul-Uloom where it
        stands on par with world leaders in the field of education. His dream
        for Anwar-ul-Uloom encompasses an umbrella organization whose
        institutions set benchmarks in education and scale new academic peaks.
