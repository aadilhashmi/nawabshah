          <b>NAWAB SHAH ALAM</b> This institution has been established under the
          aegis of MADARSA-I-AIZZA, a registered educational society registered
          on 28th December 1961 under the Hyderabad societies registration Act
          No. 1 of 1350 fosli. In fact the Madrasa-i-aizza was founded in the
          year 1876 AD by the efforts of Moulvi Shaik Ahmed Husain sahib, Nawab
          Rafi Yar Jung, with the express object of imparting liberal /
          scientific / professional education to the children of Muslim
          community.

          In the year 1945, the school was made a feeder of the Osmania
          University preparing students for the H.S.C public examinations. The
          late Nawab Sir Nizamath Jung, an illustrious son of the founder was
          associated with the school as honorary secretary for over 50 years
          till he retired in 1947 and during his regime the school made rapid
          strides on the path of progress. Telugu medium classes were opened as
          parallel section in the year 1955. In 1964, English classes were
          opened and in the year 1987, a modern school in English medium with
          name ?Neo School Aizza? was established. The year 1999 was a landmark
          in the history of the educational society when the management decided
          to start an engineering college in the educationally backward region
          of ADILABAD. The engineering college is functioning for the past 8
          years very successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          The college is one of the best engineering colleges imparting quality
          education with values. It is affiliated to Jawaharlal Nehru
          Technological University (JNTU) and approved by All India Council for
          Technical Education (AICTE).
